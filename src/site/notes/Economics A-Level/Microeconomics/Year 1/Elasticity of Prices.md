## Consequences of Externalities 📊

| Type of Externality  |   Consequences   |
|:--------------------:|:----------------:|
| Negative Production  |  Overproduction  |
| Negative Consumption | Overconsumption  |
| Positive Production  | Underproduction  |
| Positive Consumption | Underconsumption |
## Internalising Externalities: Policy Tools 🔨

**Indirect Tax 💵**
An indirect tax is a levy imposed on activities that generate negative externalities, aiming to internalise the external costs and promote social efficiency.

Pros:
- Works through the price mechanism to move the market toward the social optimum.
- Generates revenue that can compensate those harmed by the external cost.

Cons:
- Difficult to monitor and to determine the optimal tax level.
- Regressive; it hits low-income households hardest.

**Quality Controls (Regulation) 🏦**
Pros:
- Enforced by fines or imprisonment, making avoidance harder than in a purely market setting.
- Can set standards that keep the externality close to the social optimum.

Cons:
- May eliminate beneficial production along with the harmful side-effects, potentially causing unemployment.
- Restricts personal freedom, is costly to enforce, and can push activity underground (shadow markets).

**Subsidies for Positive Externalities**
Pros:
- Prices the externality by lowering production costs, moving output toward the social optimum.
- Can generate long-term benefits, such as healthier workers who pay more taxes.

Cons:
- Information problems: determining the optimal subsidy size is hard.
- Opportunity cost: tax money could be spent elsewhere; risk of bureaucratic inefficiency.
## Key Concepts and Definitions 📚

> **Private Costs** – Costs incurred by producers or consumers directly involved in the transaction (e.g., wages, raw material expenses).

> **External Costs (Negative Externalities)** – Costs imposed on third parties not involved in the market transaction (e.g., pollution, noise, congestion).

> **Social Costs** – The sum of private and external costs:  

> **Marginal Private Benefit (MPB)** – The additional benefit received by an individual from consuming or producing one more unit.  

> **Marginal Private Cost (MPC)** – The additional cost borne by a producer or consumer for one more unit.  

> **Marginal Social Benefit (MSB)** – Total benefit to society from one extra unit:  

> **Marginal Social Cost (MSC)** – Total cost to society from one extra unit:  

> **Market Failure** – Occurs when the free market does not allocate resources efficiently, often due to externalities, leading to a divergence between market equilibrium (MPB = MPC) and the social optimum (MSB = MSC).

## Significance of Externalities & Welfare Loss 📉

- The magnitude of welfare loss depends on the price elasticity of demand (PED) for the MPB and the size of the externality (e.g., time‑related damage).
- Identifying who bears the cost and whether government intervention can mitigate the externality are crucial for policy design.

## Free Markets Solve the Basic Economic Problem 🏪

- Markets assign values to scarce resources; price adjustments reflect changes in supply and demand, providing incentives that guide allocation decisions.
