## Consequences of Externalities 📊

| Type of Externality  |   Consequences   |
|:--------------------:|:----------------:|
| Negative Production  |  Overproduction  |
| Negative Consumption | Overconsumption  |
| Positive Production  | Underproduction  |
| Positive Consumption | Underconsumption |
## Internalising Externalities: Policy Tools 🔨

**Indirect Tax 💵**
An indirect tax is a tax imposed by the government that increases the supply costs of producers.

Pros:
- Works through the price mechanism to move the market toward the social optimum.
- Generates revenue that can compensate those harmed by the external cost.

Cons:
- Information gap: it's difficult to monitor and to determine the optimal tax level.
- They're regressive as they hit the poor the hardest.

**Quality Controls (Regulation) 🏦**
Pros:
- Enforced by fines/ imprisonment; this makes avoidance harder than in a free market economy.
- Can set standards that keep the externality close to the social optimum.

Cons:
- It may have harmful side-effects, causing unemployment.
- It can encourage the creation of a shadow market as QCs are costly to enforce.

**Subsidies for Positive Externalities 🤑**
Pros:
- Prices the externality by lowering production costs, moving output toward the social optimum.
- Can generate long-term benefits, such as healthier workers who pay more taxes.

Cons:
- Information problems: determining the optimal subsidy size is hard.
- Opportunity cost: tax money could be spent elsewhere, and there's risk of bureaucratic inefficiency.
## Key Concepts and Definitions 📚

> **Private Costs** - Private costs are the costs incurred by individuals or firms directly involved in an economic activity. These are the costs of producing a good or service that are borne solely by the producer or consumer.

> **External Costs (Negative Externalities)** - When producing or consuming a good or service imposes a cost (negative effect) upon a third party.

> **Social Costs** - Social costs are the total costs of an economic activity, which include both private costs and any external costs.

> **Marginal Private Benefit (MPB)** - The additional benefit received by an individual from consuming or producing one more unit.  

> **Marginal Private Cost (MPC)** - The additional cost borne by a producer or consumer for one more unit.  

> **Marginal Social Benefit (MSB)** - Total benefit to society from one extra unit:  

> **Marginal Social Cost (MSC)** - Total cost to society from one extra unit:  

> **Market Failure** - Market failure happens when the price mechanism **fails to allocate scarce resources efficiently** or when the operation of market forces lead to a **net social welfare loss**

## Free Markets Solve the Basic Economic Problem 🏪

- Markets assign values to scarce resources; price adjustments reflect changes in supply and demand, providing incentives that guide allocation decisions.
