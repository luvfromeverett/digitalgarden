A "ban on tobacco advertising" is a form of government intervention, usually used to halt the negative externalities that occur as a result of this (as "tobacco" is a demerit good, as it causes "cancer" and is a "leading cause of preventable deaths"). It may result in a decrease in the revenue of tobacco firms as "consumption" may "decrease". This is because one of the things that impact consumption is advertising - especially as "tobacco companies spend tens of billions of dollars each year on advertising". As advertising falls, tobacco may be less of a societal 'taste' that people crave - therefore, overtime, tobacco may fall out of 'fashion' in society. Consequently, this will cause a shift in the demand to the left, from D to D1. Thus, the quantity demanded of this good will fall, from Q to Q1. Because of this, the revenue tobacco firms generate will fall (using quantity demanded * price), from 3.5Q1/2 to 3Q1. This is because the amount that firms supply to consumers will fall over time, as demand falls (theory of demand).

**With reference to Extract A and your own knowledge, assess whether the supply of uranium is likely to be price elastic or price inelastic (10)**

The supply of uranium may be price elastic in terms of its supply. This is because the available stock of uranium is quite high, given that there are "large stockpiles" of Uranium, especially since "Kazakhstan's production has increased significantly"(given that it has the second largest "known resource of uranium"). Consequently, as the availability of uranium is quite large, it may have less scarcity. Therefore, this may make the quantity supplied (by firms of this good) very responsive to a change in demand, and thus a change in price. This is because, given its availability, the quantity supplied by firms may be a greater proportion than the change in price. 

Nevertheless, this may be an erroneous argument. This is because there may be a production lag (making price elasticity of supply inelastic), wherein the change in price is not instantly met by an increase in supply - especially as, in the case of Extract A, "some firms have ceased production", making the supply chain in which uranium is made more delicate. Thus, when price rises, there may be a period of time wherein the market is not in allocative efficiency, as the market has to respond by building new "uranium mines", which takes time given the "many regulations" that are involved in making a "uranium mine" (given that we do not live in entirely free markets). An example of this is in Spain, where a plant there has been "in development for more than a decade"

Moreover, the supply of uranium may be price inelastic because the substitutability of the factors of production (e.g. staff) may be low. This is because, given the immense "government regulations" that are involved in making and taking care of a "uranium mine", the ceiling of entry for staff in this sector may be particularly high. This is because the sector is a highly technical one, as it requires knowledge of the sciences, how uranium works and the safety protocols behind it. Therefore, companies may not be able to  respond to a change demand, and thus a change in price by hiring people from zero-hour contracts for example, like in the fast food sector. Instead, they may have to train more people, which again, may take time, and may be why the mine in Spain has "been in development for more than a decade". Therefore, in this case, a change in price may be greater than a change in elasticity, meaning PES will be less than 1.

Nevertheless, this may also be an erroneous argument; in the short term, when staff aren't hired, sure, PES may be less than 1, and therefore, it may be inelastic. But overtime, when more staff are trained and hired, PES may become elastic (and therefore may be greater than 1), as firms will have a greater capacity to respond to a change in price, therefore reducing the production lag and, thus, the time it takes to produce one unit of uranium.

WWW: great application and great rebuttal
EBI: you drew a hypothetical PES graph and used the hypothetical QD and P (e.g. QD, QD1, P, P1) to explain how **revenue** would've marginally/substantially increased.
