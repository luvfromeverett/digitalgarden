**With reference to Figure 2, explain *one* likely reason for the change in the Chile peso exchange rate between 2013 and 2015 (5)**

An exchange rate is a way of comparing two or more currencies. This is done via FOREX, wherein the value of a currency is determined by how much it can buy another currency (i.e. how much one currency is worth when converted into another currency) **(1)**. In 2013, the price of 100 Chile pesos was ~$0.2 **(1)**, and in 2015, that had fallen to ~$0.16 **(1)**. One reason for this fall (and the weakening of the Chile pesos against the dollar) could be because of inflation increasing. One consequence of a rising rate of inflation is usually a shift in AD, to the right. This could be because of the inflationary pressures that come from an increase in consumption across the economy - which is known as 'demand pull inflation' **(1)**. As demand for goods and services increases across the economy, inflationary pressures rise because firms are more likely to increase their prices to ration demand. Moreover, this links to the exchange rate because, when the value of a currency falls, exports become cheaper (because they are more competitive), and imports become more expensive, increasing net trade, and thereby shifting AD to the right from the sum of its components: C+I+G+(X-M) **(1)**. Thus, in the case of the Chilean economy, inflation could've risen, thereby increasing AD, and therefore weakening the Chilean pesos against the US dollar.
