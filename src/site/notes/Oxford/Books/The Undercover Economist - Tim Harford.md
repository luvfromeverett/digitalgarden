# ☕ Chapter 1: It's More Than Just a Cup of Coffee

> In this chapter, ==Tim Harford talked about what really is behind the cup of coffee we drink everyday== - linking this rather mundane topic to a much larger issue about scarce resources in our economy, and how the scarcity of resources is allocated in an economy.
## 🛒 The Logic Behind Coffee Shops

|              High Volume Coffee Shops              |         Low Volume Traffic Coffee Shops          |
| :------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------: |
| High rent from landlords (higher bargaining power) | Less rent from landlords (less bargaining power) |

> This ultimately comes back to the idea of who has power in an economy - who has the most 'bargaining power'. In an area with a high volume of traffic - such as Euston Station - those who own the land have the most 'bargaining power'. This is because what they own is infinitely scarce - i.e. you can't just 'make' new land. However, those who want to rent out the land for coffee purposes do not hold anything of much scarcity - because, ultimately, there are many coffee chains, and only one of this very land. Hence, this makes the rent of these very coffee shops insanely high, because the land owners are providing the derived demand. 
- This one fundamental idea links to nearly everything in our economy. The Green Belt, for example, is a great example of this. Many people have been proclaiming - recently - that they do not want the government to 'build on the greenbelt'. By doing this, house prices have shot up over time.
	- This makes the housing supply price inelastic, wherein political resistance (mainly by the salaried classes) helps maintain this scarcity.
