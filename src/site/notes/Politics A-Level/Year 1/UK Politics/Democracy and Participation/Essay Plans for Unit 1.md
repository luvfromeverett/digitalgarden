**Evaluate the view that apart from referendums, the introduction of other forms of direct democracy would undermine representative democracy in the United Kingdom (30)**

- E-petitions and initiatives
	- The UK Parliament petitions website (e-petitions) allows members of the public to create and support petitions for consideration by the Parliament of the United Kingdom. They were introduced in 2010 as a way to gather more public engagement in politics. 
	- The Petitions Committee (also known as the Backbenchers Business Committee) may consider a petition for debate if it receives 100,000 signatories. It has a right to accept whether a petition should be debated in parliament by backbenchers.
	- Following the 2011 e-petition on the Hillsborough disaster, there was a parliamentary debate, and this led to renewed momentum for an inquiry. 
		- This ultimately led to another police inquiry and prosecutions. 
		- So, it may help to clarify issues of concern and prevent anger brewing in society. 
	- The government initially said ‘it had no plans’ for a sugar tax after an e-petition calling for one, but then one was introduced by the chancellor. 
	- Another form of petition is initiatives. These are not used in the UK at the moment but are found in some US states and Switzerland. 
	- An initiative that is successful by reaching a number of votes will automatically trigger a referendum (like in Switzerland) Initiatives give people control over referendums. 
		- May improve engagement.

- Counter to e-petitions and initiatives
	- E-petitions are a lazy form of political participation, known as ‘slacktivism’.
	- It is just too easy to submit a petition, and that may be a problem for meaningful engagement.
	- Even if they are - many of these debates are not well-attended or are ill-informed in the discussion.
	- In Switzerland, minarets of Mosques were banned via an initiative - reflecting a majority attitude against Muslim migration
	- Yet the right-wing campaign gathered over 10% of petitions and then a referendum was held that came out in favour of a ban.
	- Analysis- initiatives can be a form of mob rule where vocal groups trample on minority rights (tyranny of the majority). Representatives act as more informed mediators.

- Recall Elections
	- The Recall of MPs Act 2015 made provision for constituents to be able to recall their Member of Parliament and call a by-election.
	- Proceedings are initiated only if an MP is found guilty of wrongdoing that fulfils certain criteria:
		- A custodial prison sentence of a year or less (longer sentences automatically disqualify MPs without the need for a petition due to the Representation of the People Act 1981).
		- Suspension from the House of at least ten sitting days or 14 calendar days following a report by the Committee on Standards.
		- Cameron saw recall as a way to address the expenses scandal in 2009.

- Counter to Recall Elections:
	- Recall elections in the UK are very limited.
	- There have only been three since 2015 and this shows that the ‘filter’ is in the hands of parliament.
	- Only 2 of the 3 recall petitions were successful (Ian Paisley Jr succeeded - only 9.4% of people voted for a renewed ballot).

- Outsider Pressure Groups
	- They can educate the public and increase 'citizen-led democracy' through increased participation rates.
	- Combats the 'participation crisis' the UK currently has.
		- E.G. in 1997, turnout was 72%. In 2024, it was 59.7%.
	- The BMA, often known as an insider pressure group, has used means of direct action to get its agenda through government.
		- E.G. it campaigned against smoking in cars; it got people to email their MPs, and send letters - this led to the Children and Families Act of 2015, banning smoking in cars *with children*.

- Counter to Recall Elections
	- Their success rate varies.
	- CAGE UK campaigns for Muslims and against anti-terror laws, but because it only represents ~4% of the UK population, governments are less likely to listen to them.
	- Liberty failed to stop Secret Courts being used. 
	- Insulate Britain and Extinction Rebellion: despite getting a lot of media coverage, the government have *not* adopted their policies.

**Evaluate the view that rights are no longer adequately protected in the UK (30)**

*when referring to the government in this, I will be talking about the former Conservative government of years 2010-2024*

- Government
	- Rights are protected through the passing of government legislation.
		- Human Rights Act 1998.
		- Freedom of Information Act 2000 - allows citizens to request any information held about them.
		- Equalities Act 2010 – protected characteristics such as disabilities.
		- Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2014.
			- These acts increase the protection of rights. The Human Rights Act has been extremely important in making a kind of US-style bill of rights.
		- The HRA gives citizens the right to utilise the provisions of the European Convention of Human Rights in UK courts.
		- It means that people no longer need to go through lengthy and costly trials in Strasbourg but can say that their rights, such as the right to a fair trial, have been infringed.

- Counter to Government
	- Dominic Raab, The Justice Secretary, was looking to repeal the Human Rights Act of 1998.
	- For example, under Article 8 of the ECHR, it will not be able to reach court as much as often, with 70 per cent of foreign criminals who lodge deportation appeals currently doing so under the terms of the clause.
		- The Government was proposing to add a ‘permission stage’ at the start of human rights legal cases.
		- This plan will have meant that that before a case can get off the ground, the person whose rights have been violated will have to show they have faced a “significant disadvantage” caused by the abuse of their rights.
		- A ‘British Bill of Rights’ means that foreign citizens or migrants may not have the same protections.
		- The government said the bill was designed to "help prevent trivial human rights claims from wasting judges' time" and to make it clear that UK courts do not always need to follow the decisions of European courts.
			- This shows that because parliament is sovereign, it has the ability to take away rights through a simple majority (FPTP almost always gives this).
		- Although these plans have now been abandoned, they remain on the Conservative Party agenda.
	- In addition, the government’s Elections Act 2022 makes it compulsory to bring voter ID to voting.
		- Some polls estimate 10% of voters were turned away in 2024 because of their lack of ID.

- Supreme Court      
	- The Supreme Court has the ability to protect rights through powers of judicial review and declarations of incompatibility.
	- The Human Rights Act 1998 allows judges to declare legislation passed by Parliament ‘incompatible’ with the European Convention of Human Rights.
	- Since the Human Rights Act came into force on 2 October 2000, UK courts have made 29 declarations of incompatibility.
	- E.G. Supreme Court declaration against Department of Work and Pensions -July 2014. 
		- The case concerned two claimants who were on Back to Work Schemes. Caitlin Reilly was made to work in Poundland for two weeks, and Jamie Wilson was required to work 30 hours a week for six months for free as part of the Community Action Programme. The Jobseekers Act 2013 was seen to be incompatible.
	- The UKSC can cite the Magna Carta to uphold rights and their powers.

- Counter to the Supreme Court
	- However, the power of the Supreme Court is limited as, unlike in the US, the court cannot strike down laws saying that they no longer stand and therefore, their scope to protect these rights is limited.
	- After the Belmarsh Judgment 2003, the government introduced “control orders” instead, which is a form of house arrest, and while amendments to the law were occurring, prisoners whose human rights had been infringed remained in prisons.
		- Governments are not required to change the law; when they do, they often ‘tweak’ the law.
		- Therefore, while obvious human rights violations may have to be amended, small amendments may not fix the root of the violation and just make it harder for the Supreme Court to rule against it.
	- The Supreme Court, as an unelected body, does not want to sound too political and, therefore, prefers to restrain itself from consistently declaring against legislation produced by an elected government.
	- The Judicial Review Act 2022 makes it harder for people to challenge the Government’s actions in court.
		- This means that when an immigration tribunal rejects an asylum application, they can no longer seek a judicial review.

- Pressure Groups and Rights
	- Pressure groups can be seen to have a large role in assuring rights are protected in the UK
		- For example, it helped to ensure that the law introducing the use of ID cards in the UK was repealed.
	- Stonewall protects LGBTQ+ rights.
		- Helped get the Marriage Act of 2015 through Parliament.
	- The Children Act case - In 2003, the Howard League took the government to court and argued that the Children Act 1989 must apply to children in custody, too. The case was won, and welfare support for children in and out of custody was secured.

- Counter to Pressure Groups and Rights
	- Most pressure groups are not that effective because they do not enjoy insider status with the government.
	- Liberty failed to stop Secret Courts.
	- CAGE UK. They are a group campaigning to empower Muslims and against anti-terror laws.
		- They have had little influence on government policies, mainly due to their lack of electoral power.
		- With only 4.3% Muslims in the UK, they only account for a small minority, lessening the likelihood of the government listening to their views.
	- If anything, governments double down on their ‘tough’ policies to win votes.
	- And the press picks up on any sign of weakness.
