# 📚 Korean War Origins

### Key Points

- **Defensive Perimeter Strategy** limited U.S. commitments to East Asia.
    
- Soviet arming of North Korea and Stalin’s approval triggered the invasion.
    
- U.S. failure to assure South Korea created uncertainty for Rhee.
    
- The 1946 Autumn Uprising revealed widespread domestic unrest under U.S. occupation.


---

## 🔫 Before the War
- There was a division of Korea after Japan fell, along the 38th parallel
- No agreement was made between the USSR/US over unification; consequently, the two zones formed as independent states in 1948.
- The US wanted reunification with Rhee as leader.
- The USSR did not support the elections that the UN held in 1948 (the USSR was protesting the UN due to their refusal to let China become a member at the time, therefore they were unable to Veto this decision).
- Stalin wanted a buffer zone as it shared a border with Korea, and the Capitalist South Korea.
- The USSR did not want a direct conflict with the US.

## 📜 Defensive Perimeter Strategy (12 Jan 1950)

> **Definition:** The _Defensive Perimeter Strategy_ was a U.S. policy outlining the limits of American commitment in East Asia during early 1950, aiming to contain Soviet influence without direct confrontation.

- **Key points from Acheson’s view**
    
    1. The strategy sought to maintain a **defensive line** around U.S. interests.
        
    2. It was **underestimated** by the USSR, PRC, and DPRK, who saw it as a sign of U.S. weakness.
        
    3. The policy directly influenced the **Korean situation**, encouraging North Korean aggression.

## ⚔️ Causes of the Korean War – Competing Arguments

> **Definition:** Historians debate whether the war stemmed primarily from **super‑power rivalry** or **internal Korean dynamics**.

### 1️⃣ Superpower Politics Argument

- **Cold War context**: The USSR supported **Kim Il Sung**; Stalin’s shift after the Soviet nuclear test signalled boldness.
    
- **U.S. posture**: The United States failed to prevent the **Communist victory in China**, emboldening North Korea.
    
- **Result**: Global ideological struggle translated into a regional conflict.

### 2️⃣ Korean Society Argument

- **Deep national division**: Post‑World War II split **(38th Parallel)** created separate **Northern** and **Southern** regimes.
    
- **Southern regime’s unpopularity**: Widespread discontent with Rhee’s government fuelled instability.
    
- **Stalin’s involvement**: Direct Soviet backing of Kim Il Sung emphasized local leadership's reliance on external powers.
    
- **U.S. initial plan**: The United States originally intended to **divide Korea**, inadvertently setting the stage for conflict.

| Perspective         | Main Drivers                                | Key Actors                   | Evidence                                    |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Superpower Politics | Ideological competition, nuclear deterrence | USSR (Stalin), USA (Acheson) | Soviet nuclear test, U.S. inaction in China |
| Korean Society      | Internal division, regime legitimacy        | Kim Il Sung, Rhee Syng‑man   | 1946 railroad strike, Southern unpopularity |
1. It was the USSR's support of Kim Il Sung in the North that encouraged the North to invade the South, triggering the war.
2. Whilst initially restraint to the ideas of war, by spring 1950, Stalin believed that the situation had changed:
	1. The soviets had developed the first nuclear bomb in September 1949.
	2. The Americans had not directly intervened to stop the Communist victory in China.

- Nevertheless, the division of Korea was deeply unpopular, and this made it inevitable that one side would seek reunification through war.
- The regime in the South was extremely unpopular, and only managed to cling on to power through direct American military support. The widespread hatred for the regime in the South meant that the North invaded to help their Southern compatriots overthrow the unpopular Rhee regime and reunite Korea.
- Kim Il Sung's regime was heavily reliant on Soviet aid; therefore, their ability to invade the South was dependent on USSR support.

## 🌾 Autumn Uprising (1946)

> **Definition:** A massive **peasant and labour** revolt against U.S. military presence and the authoritarian Rhee regime, sparked by a railroad workers’ strike in Pusan.

- **Origins**: 8,000 railroad workers initiated a strike in **Pusan**.
    
- **Expansion**: The strike ignited a **nationwide peasant uprising** across southern Korea.
    
- **Goals**:
    
    - Opposition to **American military occupation**.
        
    - Resistance to **Rhee’s authoritarian rule** supported by the U.S.
        
- **Consequence:** this sparked a peasant uprising across SK. The uprising was against the presence of the American military in Korea and the support it gave to the Rhee regime. 


---

## 🔫 Soviet Involvement (1949‑1950)

> **Definition:** The Soviet Union **armed** Kim Il Sung and gave **Stalin’s approval** for an invasion of the South, directly shaping the onset of the Korean War.

- **Arming North Korea**: Soviet forces supplied weapons and training to Kim Il Sung’s regime.
    
- **Stalin’s permission**: In **April 1950**, Stalin authorized a full‑scale invasion.
    
- **Strategic intent**: Expansion of communist influence on the peninsula and pressure on U.S. commitments.

-> April 1950, Stalin gave permission to Kim Il Sung to invade the South.

---

## 🛑 U.S. Failure to Assure South Korea

> **Definition:** The United States did **not clearly communicate** its willingness to militarily defend South Korea, leaving Rhee uncertain about U.S. backing.

- **Lack of explicit commitment**: No direct guarantee to Rhee that the U.S. would intervene against a northern attack.
    
- **Perceived by adversaries**: Stalin and Kim Il Sung interpreted the ambiguity as **U.S. hesitation**, boosting their confidence.
    
- **Consequence**: This miscommunication contributed significantly to the decision to **launch the invasion** on 25 June 1950.

## 🌏 Why the U.S. Was Concerned About Asia

> **Definition:** American strategic anxiety focused on **communist expansion**, **resource security**, and the **economic health of post‑war Japan**.

- **Risk of communism spreading** across the region.
    
- **Loss of raw materials** essential for U.S. industry.
    
- **Impact on Japan**: A destabilized Japan could jeopardize American trade and reconstruction efforts.
